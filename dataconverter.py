This program is intended to convert labels from the EuroCity Persons (ECP) Dataset 
into txt files in the format used to train a YOLO model.

Absolute file paths -> relative file paths from current working directory
(current working directory must be repository directory, otherwise the script will not work)
Now processes training and validation data together
